            <strong>Distributed Multicast Tree Construction in Wireless Sensor Networks with Unreliable Links</strong>

            <p>
            	Wireless sensor networks (WSN) has been recognized as one of the most important technology for the 21st century, and in WSNs, multicast tree is the most common structure for the multicasting, an important data transmission pattern. Although wireless communication is notoriously unreliable,  almost all of previous works on constructing the multicast tree neglect this and assume the links are reliable. Motivated by this, we model the unreliability in terms of probability and, for the first time, design an algorithm to construct the multicast tree based on unreliable links with high time and energy efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
            	In this research, I finish almost all parts of it independently, including modeling, theoretical analysis, algorithm design, performance analysis as well as paper writing. Moreover, this research requires strong mathematical background, and in the 30-page paper I write, more than half are theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations.
            </p>

            <p>
            	We are going to submit our work to <strong>SIGMETRICS 2020</strong>.

              <a href="https://www.bancor.network/">Bancor</a> holds the record for the biggest crowd-funding, ever, in the history of mankind. However, the robustness and efficiency of Bancor remain to be explored. Bancor also has several flaws due to its design principle.
            <br>
              Therefore, we build a simulator, and leveraging which, we find that Bancor protocol is flawed in three aspects: 
            <ul>
              <li>The existence of problem about <a href="https://www.bancor.network/whitepaper">"Double Coincidence of Wants"</a> Bancor wants to solve is unsubstantiated in real world. Even assuming this problem does exist, Bancor protocol cannot ensure its superiority to classic market.</li>
              <li>The price of smart token, i.e. currency in Bancor protocol could fluctuate significantly, since Bancor neglects potential human behavior. </li>
              <li>Bancor protocol is faced with severe cancellation of concurrent transactions under limited order.</li>
            </ul>

              Many realistic social networks can be presented by evolving bipartite graphs, in which dynamically added elements are divided into two entities and connected by links through these two entities, such as followees and followers in Twitter networks, authors and scientific topics in scholarly networks, users and items in recommendation networks, and etc. However, when adding weights of edges, i.e., connections between elements, how to mathematically model such evolving social networks, along with quantitative characterizations, remains unexplored.
            <br>
              Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving bipartite model (EBM), which, based on empirically validated power-law distribution within multiple realistic social networks, discloses that the distribution of total weights given or received by each element in networks is determined by the weighting scale and bounded by certain ceilings and floors.

            Scholarly networks contain massive scholarly information that can be mainly categorized into three entities, i.e., paper, author and topic, which exhibit a co-evolution over time. <br>
            Though scholarly networks have attracted much attention over the past years, most works focus on single dimension of the network, e.g. citation, collaboration or topic network; while few of them incorporate different kinds of entities into an entirety to generate a systematic understanding of scholarly networks at scale. We bridge this gap by proposing a multi-entity scholarly model (MSM) with succinct theoretical foundation, which amalgamates entities of paper, author and topic into one single framework to simulate interactions among different entities, and thus presenting the co-evolution within scholarly networks.

              Besides computer science, I am also crazy about math. I have taken or audited plenty of courses held by mathematic department, such as abstract algebra and stochastic process. Moreover, I held a seminar discussing fundemental problems in mathematical analysis with a group of talented people when I was a freshman.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fascinated by the free thought and infinite possibilities, I enjoy exploring the literary world. My favorite writter is Albert Camus.
